ITRI615 Computer Security Basic Microservice Project
The SecureStore microservice built using Spring Boot acts as a simple component of a modern e-commerce platform where an admin manages the product catalogue. The web application can oversee user sessions and implements role-based access control. Endpoints are accessible locally for users to browse the products offered while restricting sensitive operations like adding, updating or deleting products. This functionality is limited to admin users only. User authentication and registration are safeguarded through password hashing using Bcrypt, and session security is improved using features such as timeout on inactivity, preventing session fixation, and limits number of concurrent sessions. By isolating these functions in a dedicated service, the system promotes scalability, enforces strict authorisation policies, and secures both user data and product information. These security practices are crucial for preventing unauthorised access, guarding data and upholding trust and compliance standards.
